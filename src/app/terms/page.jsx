      <p>
        These terms of use sets out the terms and conditions for your Global
        Ukraine FinTech App personal account (your account) and its related
        services. These terms and conditions, along with the Fees, Privacy
        Policy and any other terms and conditions that apply to our services,
        form a legal agreement (the agreement) between: you, the account holder;
        and us, Global Business Hub France Ltd (a company incorporated in France
        under the registration number 888 935 202, VAT FR 41 888 935 202, and
        whose registered head office is at 8 Graham Bell street, 57070 Metz,

        Money Institution regulated by the Bank of Lithuania (№ 75); and managed
        by GBH France SAS. This agreement is indefinite. It means that it is
        valid until you or we end it. It's important for you to understand how
        your account works. You can ask for a copy of these terms and conditions
        through the Global Ukraine FinTech App at any time. If you'd like more
        information, you might find it helpful to read our FAQs (but these FAQs
        don't form part of our agreement with you).
      </p>
      <h3 className="py-[16px]">Type of account</h3>
      <p>
        Your account with us is a payment account and the money in it is held by
        us as a deposit. This type of account is commonly called a “current
        account” and it is a type of bank account where you can store and
        withdraw money, and make payments. In these terms and conditions, we may
        refer to it as the “Global Ukraine FinTech App Account”, a “current
        account” or an “account”. The accounts can be individual (you must not
        use it for business purposes) and professional (for freelancers and/or
        corporates), that can be used for business purposes. We do not pay
        interest on the deposits in your current account.
      </p>
      <h3 className="py-[16px]">Accessibility of Global Ukraine FinTech App and card</h3>
      <p>
        The opening of the account is only possible if you can present an
        address (permanent or temporary) in Europe.
      </p>
      <h3 className="py-[16px]">Using money in your account</h3>
      <p>
        Once you have money in your account you'll be able to use our services.
        For example, you can do the following: send money to and receive money
        from other Global Ukraine FinTech App accounts and non- Global Ukraine
        FinTech App accounts; make payments and withdraw cash using your Global
        Ukraine FinTech App; and view information about and manage your account.
        We add new features and services all the time. We’ll let you know about
        these through the Global Ukraine FinTech App.
      </p>
      <h3 className="py-[16px]">Transferring money between Global Ukraine FinTech App accounts</h3>
      <p>
        You can send money to, and receive money from, other Global Ukraine
        FinTech App accounts. All these transfers are received immediately and
        are free.
      </p>
      <h3 className="py-[16px]">Keeping your security details and Global Ukraine FinTech App safe</h3>
      <p>
        You can contact us through the Global Ukraine FinTech App, as soon as
        possible, if your Global Ukraine FinTech App is lost or stolen, or if
        your Global Ukraine FinTech App or security details could be used
        without your permission. If you can, you should, without undue delay,
        also “freeze” your Global Ukraine FinTech App. If you later realize
        there’s not a risk to your Global Ukraine FinTech App's security, you
        can unfreeze it.
      </p>
      <h3 className="py-[16px]">Payment limits</h3>
      <p>
        Due to the anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing
        requirements or the limits applied by third parties, we might limit how
        much you can receive into or pay from your account, or how much you can
        withdraw or spend using your Global Ukraine FinTech App. These limits
        can change from time to time. Information about these limits is
        regularly set out in this document.
      </p>
      <h3 className="py-[16px]">Account suspension or closure</h3>
      <p>
        We may close or suspend your account immediately, in some exceptional
        circumstances, include the following: if we have good reason to suspect
        that you are behaving fraudulently or otherwise criminally; if you
        haven't given us (or someone acting on our behalf) any information we
        need, or we have good reason to believe that information you have
        provided is incorrect or not true; if you've broken these terms and
        conditions in a serious or persistent way and you haven't put the matter
        right within a reasonable time of us asking you to; if we have
        information that your use of the Global Ukraine FinTech App is harmful
        to us or our software, systems or hardware; if we have good reason to
        believe that you continuing to use your account could damage our
        reputation or goodwill; if we have asked you to repay money you owe us
        and you have not done so within a reasonable period of time; if you've
        been declared bankrupt; or if we have to do so under any law,
        regulation, court order or ombudsman’s instructions. We may also decide
        to close or suspend your account for other reasons. We would contact you
        through the Global Ukraine FinTech App at least sixty (60) days before
        we do this. Closing your account and ending the agreement may also end
        any other agreements you have with us or through us. You can get more
        information through the Global Ukraine FinTech App or by contacting us.
        If you change your mind and don't want a Global Ukraine FinTech App any
        more, that's not a problem. Just let us know and we'll cancel it.
