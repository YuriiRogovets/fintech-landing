            We process and store your data as long as you remain a Global
            Ukraine App user. We only keep your data for the time necessary to
            fulfil the purpose of collection. You may request us to close your
            account at any time and delete your data after account closure. We
            may retain certain data after account closure due to legal or
            regulatory requirements. We are legally obliged to retain certain
            data for a minimum of 5 to 7 years after ending the customer
            relationship and in other cases up to 10 years, as in the case of
            accounting obligations.

            We are able to store personal data for longer periods with a valid
            legal ground, or when the data is sufficiently pseudonymized or
            anonymized.
